# ChitChatAPI
ChitChatAPI is a REST API back-end for an instant messaging mobile and web application, [ChitChat](https://github.com/ryanbrandt/ChitChat).
### Functionality & Design ###
1) Supports all CRUD operations, allowing the front-end to handle data as necessary while being completely separated from the back-end logic and design
2) Security -- user and superuser token-based authentication ensures data access is only provided to those with proper permissions
3) Scalable -- efficient schema design to ensure optimal time complexity on queries and space complexity in storage
4) Readable -- intuitive endpoint design and response/request body structure 
### Implementation ###
1) Django
2) Django Rest Framework
3) Django-Channels
4) PostgreSQL
